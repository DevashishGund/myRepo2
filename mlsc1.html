		<h3>Introduction:</h3>Microsoft Learn Student Club (MLSC), VIT Pune, is a student-driven technical club aimed at
		creating a collaborative learning environment where students can enhance their technical, professional, and
		leadership skills. Backed by Microsoft Learn, the club bridges the gap between academics and industry by
		organizing workshops, speaker sessions, hands-on projects, and hackathons. MLSC is open to all students,
		regardless of their branch, year, or even college, fostering an inclusive and diverse technical community.

		<h3>Objective:</h3>The primary objective of MLSC is to empower students with industry-relevant skills through
		experiential learning opportunities. By organizing free workshops, speaker sessions, and technical events, the
		club helps students gain practical exposure to emerging technologies such as Cloud Computing, Web Development,
		Artificial Intelligence, and more. Through these initiatives, the club also aims to foster collaboration across
		disciplines and connect students with industry experts to guide them in their career journeys.

		<h3>Vision:</h3>To establish Microsoft Learn Student Club as a premier technical community at VIT Pune that
		empowers students to innovate, build projects, and grow professionally through collaborative learning and
		real-world experiences. The club envisions becoming a hub for technical excellence, helping students showcase
		their talents on larger platforms and preparing them for global opportunities.

		<h3>Mission:</h3>Learn, Build, Empower — This guiding principle reflects our commitment to:
		<ul>
			<li>Learn: Enabling students to explore new technologies through expert-led sessions and self-paced learning
				tracks.</li>

				hackathons, and contributing to open-source.</li>
			<li>Empower: Helping students showcase their work, connect with industry leaders, and develop leadership
				skills by actively organizing and managing events.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Additional Impact:</h3>MLSC also contributes to the extracurricular development of students by providing
		opportunities to host events, work in teams, and take up leadership roles, thereby nurturing soft skills such as
